Release Details:
----------------

Release v1.0.0, May 07th, 2018

Initial project release, built on Python3 (v3.6.4). No support for earlier versions of Python yet. This is currently
just a quick & dirty Auth0 Middleware implementation based on the micro Flask App documentation they had listed on their
site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.1, May 08th, 2018

Added and updated the project README!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.2, May 08th, 2018

Added and implemented a Python logger to capture Auth0Middleware data. Added `__version__`, `VERSION`, and `__name__`
variables to the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.3, May 08th, 2018

Added handling of no Authorization header in the incoming Request. No Authorization will append the fields:
`{ 'auth': None }` onto the req.context object going to the responder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.4, May 08th, 2018

How many times am I going to change this today? Who knows! I really should add tests...

Added handling template for returned JWT claims, but final implementation will probably be in v1.0.4+.

Fixed JSON loads TypeError when parsing the return object from urlopen(_jwks_uri), because _jwks_uri is an HTTPResponse
object, and not a String, bytes, or bytearray object. It is now a String.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.5, May 08th, 2018

Fifth micro-release today! Fixed AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower' when parsing a non-existant
Authorization header.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.6, May 08th, 2018

Just in time for EOD, there is a sixth micro-update, now adding a method for pulling the access_token required to
verify the JSON Web Token.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.7, May 08th, 2018

Changed getting access_token solely from the Request body, because HEAD and GET request don't have that. So it'll first
check for the header X-Auth-Token, then resort to the body or the query string to find the access_token.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.8, May 09th, 2018

Fixed a bug when parsing claims. Before, it would not recognize the variable `__claims`, because it belongs to the
AbstractBaseMiddleware, now `__claims` can be called through `.claims` in the Auth0Middleware.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.9, May 09th, 2018

Removed typing by `var: type = ...` to help support Python 3.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.1.0, May 10th, 2018

Supporting Python 3.5 probably is fruitless, because the `typing` library doesn't include `NoReturn`, so giving that up
for the time being. Right now, falcon-auth0 only supports Python 3.6 and higher. As for that, the function to process
the decoded JWT claims has been finished, and the build status can be changed from Alpha to Production!
